Student project to check how does React works

No any step-by-step guide will be used.
Created to learn how does React works. Only about Basics, not about default react project architecture.
Plan is to use Redux and some random UX component.
Check how does information storage will work. Back-end was not planned at the beginning ( data will be stored somewhere at browser )
